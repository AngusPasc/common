Common Code Utilities
=====================

Common Code Utilities is a collection of source code, scripts, and various other utilities, that are shared among my other projects. The purpose of this repository is to be included in my other repositories as a submodule. That way, those other repositories have direct access to all files in this repository. Common Code Utilities is not meant to be used as a standalone project. However, for convenience sake, it can be compiled on its own, e.g. to validate code changes.

One example of files in this repository is the source code of various Delphi components. Some of these components are third-party and others have been written from scratch.

Another such example is shared Git/build scripts.
