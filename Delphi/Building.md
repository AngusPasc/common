Installing Borland Delphi
-------------------------

All of my Delphi projects are written for Borland Delphi 4 with all four update packs applied. Other versions of Delphi may or may not work but are unsupported. I don't have the intention or commitment to make my projects work with other Delphi versions, but pull requests to add such compatibility are still welcome of course.

If you don't have access to Delphi 4 (which is admittedly a *very* old version), please don't hesitate to send me an e-mail and we'll work something out.

Building
--------

To build the project from the command line, open a Windows command prompt in the repository directory, run the `compile.bat` script and follow the instructions.

If you also want to compile the project from within Delphi, some additional steps are required. These are outlined in the next sections.
