Installing Borland Delphi
-------------------------

All of my Delphi projects are written for Borland Delphi 4 with all four update packs applied. Other versions of Delphi may or may not work but are unsupported. I don't have the intention or commitment to make my projects work with other Delphi versions, but pull requests to add such compatibility are still welcome of course.

If you don't have access to Delphi 4 (which is admittedly a *very* old version), please don't hesitate to send me an e-mail and we'll work something out.

Building
--------

To build the project from the command line, open a Windows command prompt in the repository directory, run the `compile.bat` script and follow the instructions.

If you also want to compile the project from within Delphi, some additional steps are required. These are outlined in the next sections.

Configuring the Library Path
----------------------------

Launch Delphi, go to `Tools` - `Environment Options` - `Library`, and click the `...` button for `Library Path`. Then edit your library path until it matches the following. Note that the relative paths containing `common` should be absolute paths in reality:
```
common\Delphi\LibFixed
$(DELPHI)\Lib
common\Delphi\LibUser
$(DELPHI)\Bin
$(DELPHI)\Imports
common\Delphi\Imports
common\Delphi\LibUser\Virtual Treeview\Source
common\Delphi\LibUser\Virtual Treeview\Design
```

Package Installation
--------------------

If you also want to view or edit the project's forms, you need to install some additional design packages so that the Delphi IDE recognizes the third-party components used in these forms. Otherwise, if you just want to edit the code, you can skip this step and choose `Cancel` when the Delphi IDE tells you that a class can't be found.

First, make sure that you have built the `common` repository successfully. This is required to install the `tdebaets_comps.bpl` package. If you cloned a repository that includes `common` as a submodule, open a Windows command prompt in the repository directory and run these commands:
```
> cd common
> compile.bat
```

However, if you also intend to make changes to files in the `common` repository itself, you should create a separate clone of that repository and build that clone first.

Successful compilation of `common` should lead to the creation of the `tdebaets_comps.bpl` file in `Delphi\LibUser`, which should be added as a design package in the Delphi IDE (`Component` - `Install Packages...`).
